    "#### Almost 1 year back when I first wanted to try my hands on Neural network, I scratched my head for a long time on how Back-Propagation works. When I talk to peers around my circle, I see a lot of people facing this problem. Most people consider it as a black-box and use libraries like Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch which provide automatic differentiation. Though it is not necessary to write code on how to compute gradients and backprop errors, having knowledge on it helps you in understanding a few concepts like Vanishing Gradients, Saturation of Neurons and reasons for random initialization of weights."
